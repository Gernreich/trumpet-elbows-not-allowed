# The spiral bore

**The second design here that exists in wood**, and the only one that is not a
lattice walk. A rectangle swept along a flat coil: **1000mm of centreline** in
19 facets of 45° — 17 of them the coil, with a straight lead in and out —
winding out from **R34.7 to R112.9**. Two faces of the tube are flat and two are
faceted, which is what a swept curve buys — the section grows **+8.2%** at a
mitre where a 90° lattice corner grows 41.4%.

Its viewer is a page of its own: drag to rotate, and the slider reveals the
spiral a facet at a time. **[Turn it →](../built/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113.html)**

## The cheek is the whole drawing

The cheek sheet has been cut, and cut twice, because the two cheeks are the same
part and both go on the same way up.

![The two cheek plates as cut, one lying on the other on a scratched workbench: a faceted band of pale masked ply winding a little over two turns out from a small centre to a straight tail, both rims crenellated with open notches, a number engraved beside each notch, and a small square hole at the inner end](../built/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113-1000mm-ported-square-narrow-cheek-x2-as-cut_web.jpg)
The band is a single closed outline of 40 vertices, 216.50 × 218.51mm on a
236.50 × 238.51mm sheet, and it carries **149 mortices** for 36 wall panels.
Every one of those mortices is open at the rim, which is what `--narrow` buys:
the cheek is no wider than the duct, so each tab is held across its thickness on
one side only. The square hole near the inner end is the port — a 10mm square,
drawn 9.85mm because the 0.15mm kerf opens it the rest of the way, and square
rather than round because `--port-square` asks for the bore's own section. The
wall panels that stand in the mortices are a second sheet, 574.95 × 96.60mm, and
are not in the photograph.

**36 panels and not 38**, because the square port is what makes the lead panel
go away. Each wall's lead is 20mm and carries a single tooth, dead centre, right
where the port wants to be; `--port-square` folds that panel into the facet it
already lies on — they are collinear, so nothing about the airway moves — and
two panels with one tooth each leave the drawing. The plain sheet beside it,
with no port at all, is 38 panels and 151 mortices.

## Glued up, and not airtight

Both sheets are cut now, and the bore is glued up — the wall panels standing in
the mortices between the two cheeks, a mouthpiece on the straight tail and a
bell on the port at the inner end.

![The spiral glued up on a dark wood floor: a pale ply band winding a little over two turns, cornered at every facet, both rims crenellated with tabs and a number engraved beside each one; a straight tail leaves the outer end and carries a dark, glossy mouthpiece, and a bell engraved 10. stands on a dark ribbed throat at the inner end](../built/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113-1000mm-ported-square-narrow-cheek-x2-glued-up_web.jpg)
It is not airtight. A glue-up with this many joints — a mitre at every facet and
a tab at every mortice — leaves air gaps all along both rims, and they are
closed the same way they are closed on the built instrument: **several coats of
shellac**, which seal the ply and fill the gaps in the same pass.
**[The three-turn trumpet](../three-turn/)** is the colour it is because it has
had them.

## Finished

The spiral has had them too, and it is finished: shellacked the same amber-brown
as the three-turn, the tabs along both rims standing out darker than the faces
around them.

![The finished spiral standing upright on its bell on grey card: the bell's round rim flat on the card and its ribbed throat rising into the port at the inner end of the coil, the faceted band winding a little over two turns above it in glossy amber-brown with darker tabs along both rims, and the straight tail leaving the outer end to carry a dark ring-stacked mouthpiece up to the top left](../built/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113-1000mm-ported-square-narrow-cheek-x2-finished_web.jpg)

## The numbers

| | |
| --- | --- |
| curve | a compass spiral, stepping its arc radius facet by facet |
| centreline | 1000.0mm |
| facets | 17 at 45°, plus a straight lead in and out |
| bend radius | R34.662 at the centre out to R112.903 at the rim |
| R / bore | 3.5 at the tightest |
| airway | 10 × 10mm square, 100mm² |
| section at a mitre | +8.2% |
| play | 0.025mm per side |
| parts | 36 wall panels + 2 cheeks + 1 end cap = 39, over 2 sheets |
| the cheek | 237 × 239mm — **cut this sheet twice** |
| the wall panels | 575 × 97mm |

## Three sheets, and which one was cut

The design ships three variants, each as a cheek sheet and a panel sheet, in
`../built/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113/cut-files/`:

| | port | panels | mortices | panel sheet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `-narrow` | none | 38 | 151 | 579 × 97mm |
| `-ported-narrow` | round, 7 × 14mm | 38 + a cap | 151 | 579 × 97mm |
| **`-ported-square-narrow`** | **square, 10 × 10mm** | **36 + a cap** | **149** | **575 × 97mm** |

The square-ported one is what the photographs show. A round port needs no lead
panel moved and so keeps all 38; the square one asks for the bore's own section
and pays two panels for it.

## Rebuild it

The generator is `ribbon_bore.py`, in
`../parts/bore/concept/swept-curve/`. Report only, writing nothing:

```
python3 ribbon_bore.py --shape=spiral --port --port-square --cap --narrow
```

Every number on this page comes off that report. Writing needs an `--out` whose
name says `narrow`, which the generator insists on so a sheet cannot overwrite
its full-width twin:

```
cd parts/bore/concept/swept-curve && python3 ribbon_bore.py \
    --shape=spiral --port --port-square --cap --narrow \
    --out=../../../../built/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113/cut-files/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113-1000mm-ported-square-narrow.svg
```

**These sheets were cut.** Both of them reproduce byte-identically from the line
above, which is what makes the numbers here measurements rather than notes.
