"""Split a bore written in the agreed notation into cuttable part files.

World axes: +X right, +Y up, +Z toward you.

    N S  away / toward you    E W  east / west    U D  up / down
    (facing north, east is on your right)

    <run> <run> <run> ...

    You walk the tunnel's centreline.

        E2      re-point east, standing in the block you are already in,
                then move two blocks east

    EVERY TERM CARRIES A DISTANCE. You start at the centre of block 1 facing
    the first term -- nothing turns there -- and you leave facing the last.
    The turn at the head of a term costs no block, because it happens inside
    the block you arrived at. So the tunnel is 1 + the sum of the numbers
    blocks long, and every block where the heading changes is a stranded turn.

        E4 U2 E6        13 blocks: four east, turn up for two, turn east
                        for six. The two turning blocks are the 5th and 7th.

    A bare letter is rejected wherever it appears. In the middle it would mean
    two stranded turns butted with no run between, which is only sound when both turns
    lie in the same plane; write U1 if you really want a one-cell jog. At
    either end it used to be legal and is not: a walk opened with the heading
    you came in on and could close with the heading you left on. Both only ever
    said one of two things -- the same direction as the term beside it, which
    is nothing at all, or a turn in the first or last block, which strands that
    block as a stranded turn of its own. Neither is worth a term, so the ends are
    written like everywhere else.

Every stranded turn is the same part whichever way it turns, so a bore needs one
file plus one file per distinct run length.

EVERY EXAMPLE BELOW USED TO READ "D R1 F", which is not a walk: R and F are
not letters this notation has, and the table four lines above says so. The tool
answers `unexpected characters: 'RF'`. They are written in the letters the file
actually parses now.

    python3 bore_split.py "N2 U2" --no-write   report only
    python3 bore_split.py "N2 U2" --write DIR  cut the files into DIR
    python3 bore_split.py "N2 U2"                   a stranded turn refuses;
    python3 bore_split.py "N2 U2" --bore=10         the airway, square,
        rather than the block outside: --bore=10 is --blocksize=16 at 3mm ply.
    python3 bore_split.py "N2 U2" --bore=10 --straight=30
        straights 30mm long with the turns left cubic, so the bore lengthens
        without the walk changing. The cross-section stays square either way.
    python3 bore_split.py "N2 U2" --blocksize=22    a wider bore: the
        pitch is the sound square plus two walls, so 22 is 16mm of air in 3mm
        stock, where the default 16 is 10mm of air. Pass the same number to
        check.py or the gate measures the wrong design.

--no-write is not decoration on the first line either: with neither switch the
files go to ../../test, which is a write and was described as "report only".

# part is 16.13mm drawn and 16.00mm cut at BOTH thicknesses, because a wall
# stands between two plates and its drawn height is h + 2t, which is the block
# pitch whatever t is.
#
# The airway here is not drawn at all. It is what is left between two plates,
# 16 - 2*(the real one), and that is 10.12mm whatever number the drawing was
# made with. Passing the true sheet cannot move it; it only makes the drawing
# agree with the object, and it shortens the three wall runs that carry a
# thickness in their length by exactly 0.06mm each.
#
# ribbon_bore.py is the opposite, and this is the whole reason the two files
# treat their sheet differently: there the airway IS drawn, at
# wall_off = (BORE + THICK)/2, so putting the sheet in THICK moves the bore.

# design -- the airway is BLOCK - 2*THICKNESS, so 2.94 would make this a
# 10.12mm bore and rename every cut file from bore10- to bore10.12-. SHEET is

# joined by tab-and-slot and is solid between its mortices; this is joined by
# fingers and is a comb.

# Blocks are 1-based, as the report numbers them. The mouths go on alternate

# joint is a dozen teeth sharing an edge and the errors average out; the
# section seam is ONE tab in ONE notch, drawn exactly its own width, so a press
# fit before you add char, glue or any kerf the burn allowance did not predict.
# Reported from the bench 2026-08-31: section 1 would not enter section 2. This
# widens the notch only -- the tab keeps its full width and strength.
# Per side, so the notch opens by twice this. Measured, not guessed and not
# modelled -- every row below is an assembled object:
#
#     bore 10mm (tab 6.0 in a 10mm frame)   0.025 assembles, fits well
#                                           0.0   will not go together

#
# The 10mm bore is the extreme case, not merely a small one: the two sizing rules
# cross at exactly 10mm, where the tab is a full finger-joint tooth AND the
# shoulder is at its 2mm minimum together. Its shoulder is 0.67 of a ply. Below
# 10mm the tab has to be cut narrower than a tooth to keep any shoulder at all.
#
# Whether the requirement is absolute, a fraction of the tab, or something else
# takes a second bore to say, and there is one bore. The coupon that would settle
# it is below.
#
# This is a lookup of what has been cut, not a curve through it. It was kept in
# step by hand across two copies of this file until 2026-09-05, when the fork
# was collapsed; there is one copy now and the table moves with it. A bore not
# in the table gets the small-joint value, because too loose is a worse joint
# and too tight is no joint at all -- and pin_play() says on stderr that it is
# doing so, because a guess that looks like a measurement is the dangerous kind.
#
# The test that would settle the hypothesis needs no bore: cut a coupon of the
# two mating end frames at 22mm block -- the 16mm bore, where the tab is 7.68mm
# and the 48% fraction binds -- at 0, 0.0125 and 0.025 per side. If elastic
