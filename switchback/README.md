# The switchback trumpet

A trumpet bore that folds back on itself twice. **22 blocks, 352mm of
centreline, six sections, every turn a bend and nothing touching** — the shortest lattice
walk in the repository, and the one to cut first if you want to find out
whether the joints go together before you commit a metre of ply to it.

**[Turn it →](../parts/bore/concept/walk/coil/fold2/bore/bore.html)**
The viewer is a page of its own, not a frame in this one: drag to rotate, and
the slider reveals the bore a block at a time in the order you would glue it.

![The walk laid out in Minecraft: twenty-two translucent cubes, two straight legs reaching out left and right and a stack of turns folding between them, each section a different colour](../parts/bore/concept/walk/coil/fold2/bore/minecraft_bore.png)

## The walk is the whole design

```
N1 W3 U2 E3 N3 D3 W2 U3 N1
```

The first term is the way you face at the mouth and how far you go before
anything turns; every term after it turns where you stand and then travels that
many blocks. So **the bore is 1 + the sum
of the numbers** — 21 + 1 = 22. Axes are Minecraft's: `U`/`D` are +Y/−Y, `N` is
−Z, `S` is +Z, `E` is +X, `W` is −X.

The walk is kept in `../tools/walks/coil_fold2.txt`, and `regress.py` beside it
names this folder as where its cut files land. The viewer page carries the same
string, and the generator will read either, but they are only equal because the
page was generated from the file. Read it out of the file.

## No lead-out to write, and why that costs nothing

A walk used to be allowed to end with a bare letter naming the way you leave.
This one never did, and the notation no longer has one: you leave facing the
last term. Nothing is lost. A bare letter carrying your own heading only
restated it, and the six SVGs come out byte-identical written either way. What
it could also do was name a *different* heading — `N1 U` turned the final block
and stranded the final turn as a piece of its own — and that is the half of it
worth losing: the last block cannot be stranded any more, because there is no
longer a way to ask for one.

## The numbers

| | |
| --- | --- |
| blocks | 22 |
| centreline | 352mm |
| sections | 6 |
| parts | 40, over 6 sheets |
| bounding box | 64 × 64 × 96mm — 4 × 4 × 6 blocks |
| airway | 10mm square, constant |
| block pitch | 16mm — 10mm of air in 3mm walls |
| stranded turns | none; every turn is a bend |
| contact | none |
| legs | north 6, west 5, up 5, east 3, down 3 |

**A block is 16mm, not 10.** The bore is the air; the block is the air plus two
walls. The two numbers are 6mm apart, and a folder named for one and gated at
the other cuts a tube nobody asked for. A run of *N* blocks is 16*N* mm, which
is where 352 comes from.

## The six sections

Numbered from the mouthpiece; assemble in order. A section is one flat snake,
so it is one SVG, and every part is engraved with its section number because
the sections only go together one way.

| # | blocks | in → out | plate | shape | parts | sheet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1–3 | N → W | 2×2 | `BDL~a` | 6 | 241 × 56mm |
| 2 | 4–8 | W → E | 2×3 | `BLUUR` | 8 | 343 × 72mm |
| 3 | 9–11 | E → N | 2×2 | `BRD` | 6 | 253 × 56mm |
| 4 | 12–14 | N → D | 2×2 | `BDL` | 6 | 247 × 59mm |
| 5 | 15–19 | D → U | 3×2 | `BDLLU` | 8 | 369 × 59mm |
| 6 | 20–22 | U → N | 2×2 | `BRD~b` | 6 | 253 × 56mm |

`~a` and `~b` are the plain ends — the only two faces that do not couple to
another section, and the ones the mouthpiece and the bell land on. The
filenames say `buttin` and `buttout`.

Sections 2 and 5 are the folds: five blocks each, carrying a hairpin internally
rather than stranding its turn as a separate piece. Sections 3 and 6 are both
`BRD` and share a 253 × 56mm footprint, but they are not the same cut: section 6
ends plain at `~b`, so that face carries no fingers. All six sheets are
distinct.

## The cut files

In `../parts/bore/concept/walk/coil/fold2/bore/cut-files/`:

```
bore10-coil-fold2-01of06-bend-DL-buttin-cut-files.svg
bore10-coil-fold2-02of06-bend-LUUR-cut-files.svg
bore10-coil-fold2-03of06-bend-RD-cut-files.svg
bore10-coil-fold2-04of06-bend-DL-cut-files.svg
bore10-coil-fold2-05of06-bend-DLLU-cut-files.svg
bore10-coil-fold2-06of06-bend-RD-buttout-cut-files.svg
```

Every file is millimetre-true at 1 user unit = 1mm. **Blue engraves, then black
cuts** — blue writes the section number on every part, black frees it.

## Rebuild it

The generator lives in `../tools`. Report only, writing nothing:

```
python3 tools/bore_split.py "N1 W3 U2 E3 N3 D3 W2 U3 N1" --bore=10 --no-write
```

`--bore=10` is the airway; the 16mm block follows from it at 3mm ply. The
generator refuses a stranded turn by default, so the bend-only claim is a gate
rather than a reading.
Writing rewrites every sheet in the folder, so it runs under the venv python
that has the gate's dependencies:

```
cd tools && ~/Software/boxes/venv/bin/python bore_split.py \
    ../parts/bore/concept/walk/coil/fold2/bore/bore.html \
    --write ../parts/bore/concept/walk/coil/fold2/bore
```

## Stretched, the same walk is longer

Leave the walk alone and lengthen only the blocks that run straight, and the
tube grows without the shape changing. `--straight=30` turns this 352mm into
548mm on the same six turns. The built instrument is that idea taken three
turns further — see **[the trumpet writeup](https://gernreich.github.io/trumpet-elbows-not-allowed/)**.

## The two ends

Only the tube belongs to an instrument. Neither the mouthpiece nor the bell is
touched by the way a bore turns, and every bore here is on the same 10mm
channel, so one of each serves all of them —
**[the bell and the mouthpiece](../ends/)**.

## More, and licence

**[The three-turn trumpet](../three-turn/)** — the bore that plays, glued up
and blown, rather than a candidate.

**[The trumpet writeup](https://gernreich.github.io/trumpet-elbows-not-allowed/)** — the idea, the notation, the gate, and the whole
library.

**[The rest of the build files](https://gernreich.github.io/)** — every
instrument, each with its own writeup.
