# CLAUDE.md


**There is no README in this folder.** The swept curve has its own section in the
repository's writeup at `../../../../README.md`. This file is the note that sits
beside the generator.

**Every sheet kept here is 10mm.** `--bore` is untouched and takes any value; nothing
is shipped at another.

**Nothing OCTAGONAL is kept here** - no 45 degree torus, no traced octagonal
trumpet, no viewer page or trace for either. That line used to read "no torus",
and `--shape=torus` was kept on the argument that "the next closed ring will
want it". The next closed ring turned up:
`torus/ribbon-torus-bore10-27.6923deg-R128.572-800mm` is a **13-facet ring**,
ports on facets 0 and 6, one per cheek, 800.0mm of centreline. Thirteen facets
is not eight, so the octagon sentence still holds - it is the 45 degree ring
that is not kept, and the reason is that it lives in `torus-octagonal`, not
that a ring cannot live here.

`--trace=` is still kept on the original argument, unused.

## Working in this repository

A laser-cutting build repository. `ribbon_bore.py` is the generator and the
authority; the SVG beside it is its output and is regenerated, not edited.
Everything is 3mm birch on an xTool P2S.

`ribbon_bore.py` draws its own sheets rather than going through Boxes.py, but it
keeps Boxes.py's tooth: `TOOTH = 2 * THICK` at line 180, the figure Boxes.py's
`FingerJointSettings` uses, and it does not scale with the bore.
**Boxes.py is Florian Festi's**,
GPL-3.0-or-later, at <https://github.com/florianfesti/boxes>. It is an external
dependency -- a checkout of it, not a copy in this repository.

This is the **third** way these repositories cut a bore, and the three are not
variations on each other:

| | curve | section at a turn | why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `../walk` (`bore_split.py`) | 90° lattice turns | +41.4% | fits a walk into a box |
| `--shape=torus` | a circle, 45° facets | +8.2% | a closed constant-section loop |
| here | any planar curve | +3.5% at 30° | constant section on a smooth curve |

## The geometry, in one paragraph

Sweep a rectangle along a curve **in a plane**, with one axis normal to that
plane, and the duct has two flat faces and two cylindrical ones. Flat cuts from
the sheet; cylindrical does not, because 3mm birch will not bend to these
radii. So the curved pair are faceted, and the facet angle is the only dial:
the section is exactly `bore × bore` along a facet and `bore² / cos(φ/2)` at
each mitre.

**The centreline polyline IS the facet plan.** There is no separate faceting
step, so there is nothing for it to disagree with. `walls()` offsets it and
asserts which side came out inner, because the sign depends on which way round
the centreline was written and getting it backwards silently swaps every panel
length in the cut list.

## Which curve each shape's vertices sit on

The centreline polyline IS the facet plan, so the only thing separating one
shape from another is where its vertices were placed. Two constructions are in
use, and they are not variants of each other.

**Constant-radius arcs** — `serpentine`, `opposed`, `wave`, `spiral`,
`volute`. The radius holds all the way across an arc and changes only at a join,
where a mitre already expects a corner. `spiral` is the classical compass
spiral: one arc per facet, the radius stepping by a fixed amount. **`volute` is
a chain of SEMICIRCLES** of stepping radius about two alternating centres —
which is the case `volute/volute.py` exists to argue.

**A smooth Archimedean spiral, sampled** — `dspiral` alone. **Its vertices sit
on `r = R0 + b*theta`, taken every FACET degrees**, so the radius differs at
every vertex and no two consecutive facets share one.

It shows in the local radius along the centreline. The shipped double spiral
has **16 distinct values, R30 to R111.6**; the shipped double volute has **6**
— its two semicircles at R94 and R64, its crossover at R22, and the vertices
where those meet.

**The two are the same skeleton on different curves.** Both wind in, cross the
eye, wind back out, and are point-symmetric so that both ends reach the rim;
the volute reuses the double spiral's crossover solver almost verbatim. Only
the curve differs, and neither can be turned into the other: the double
spiral's vertices lie on one spiral about one centre, the volute's on circular
arcs about two alternating centres. Two shapes, not two spellings of one.

Do not read that as the volute being the correct one and the double spiral a
compromise. See the note beside `DS_PITCH`: offsetting a faceted centreline is
exact whatever placed its vertices, and the airway check measures 4.1e-14mm on
the double spiral. The constant-radius argument is about offsetting a SMOOTH
curve, which nothing here does.

## The walls are offset to their FACES, not their centrelines

`wall_off()` is `(BORE + THICK)/2`. A wall is `THICK` thick and its slot is
centred on the offset line, so offsetting to `BORE/2` instead puts the wall
*faces* at `(BORE - THICK)/2` and the airway comes out **`BORE - THICK`** wide:
a bore asked to be 10 x 10 cuts **7 x 10**, 70mm2 against 100, and only a
measurement of a finished part tells you.

**A check can be wrong in the same way.** One that measures the distance between
the two offset polylines and calls that the bore agrees with that error exactly.
The check here subtracts one wall thickness and is named *the airway is the bore
along every facet*, which is the thing that matters — a check named for the
quantity it measures is harder to write against the wrong one.

The height is not at risk: a panel's shoulders bear on the cheeks' inner faces,
so shoulder-to-shoulder is the bore. Only the width is, which is why such a
section measures 10 x 7 and not 7 x 7.

`wall_off()`, `cheek_off()` and `band()` are **functions**, not constants. As
constants a `--bore` on the command line keeps the default figure — and the
airway check reports the whole difference as error, which is what a check named
for its quantity buys you.

## What limits a bend, and it is not what you would guess

The inner wall is the centreline offset inward by `bore/2`, so there is no bore
at all below `R = bore/2`. **But the tooth runs out long before the geometry
does.** A Boxes.py tooth is `2 × thickness` and does *not* scale with the bore —
the same fact that forces `pin_width()` in `bore_split.py` to floor at the
tooth. At the 10mm bore and 30° facets:

    R 15   inner panel 5.09mm   shorter than one tooth
    R 20   inner panel 7.67mm   still no room for shoulders
    R 25   inner panel 10.26mm  fits, 2.13mm shoulders

R 25 is therefore the floor at this bore and this facet angle. Coarser facets
need less radius, finer facets need more: 20° wants R 35, 15° wants R 45. `build()` refuses rather than
drawing a panel that cannot hold its tab.

## A half-circle advances 2/pi of its own length

Which is the whole reason the serpentine has three lobes and long straight
runs. A 1000mm run of half-circles wants **637mm of width** whatever the lobe
count, and the bed is 600 — dividing it finer only claws back the lead-in and
shortens the panels until they cannot hold a tooth. The straight verticals are
what make it fit, because they buy length in y where there is room.

**Solve the radius against this generator's own faceted centreline**, never
against a smooth arc: an inscribed chord is **1.14% short** of the arc it
spans, so a radius picked from the arc comes out 11mm long over a metre.

## The geometry is worked out y-up and flipped once, in flip()

SVG's y runs down, so writing y-up coordinates straight out renders the shape
upside down — a hump becomes a trough, and a cut file that does not look like
the thing it makes is a cut file you check twice. `flip()` negates y at the end
of `centreline()` and **nowhere else**, so every offset, normal, mitre and label
angle downstream is computed in the flipped space and comes out right. Glyphs
are not flipped: `label()` already draws them for SVG.

The flip reverses handedness, which broke one thing that had assumed it: the
outward direction for a panel's number was a left normal with a sign flip for
the inner wall, and that is only right for one handedness. **122 of 504 engraved
points landed off the material.** It is now measured — from the centreline
segment's midpoint out to the wall segment's — which has no handedness to get
wrong.

## Long panels get more than one tooth

`teeth(L)` gives `floor((L - 2*SHOULDER + TOOTH) / (2*TOOTH))`, alternating
tooth and gap of equal width. One tab in a 90mm straight run is a hinge: it
pivots about the tab and the seam opens. It was written so that every panel on
the short test piece then shipping still took exactly one and that sheet's cut
geometry did not move — checked by comparing the cut groups as
position-independent shapes, which is the only comparison that means anything
once the packer may have reordered
them.

## A traced centreline is kept with how it was taken

`--trace=` draws a bore from stations somebody else's drawing or script fixed,
rather than from parameters this generator holds. It exists for a curve whose
shape is written down somewhere other than here.

A trace file carries the stations **and the provenance** - where they came
from, how they were taken, and what was measured off them. A traced number
without that is a number nobody can check. `traces/volute.json` is the one kept:
six semicircles of stepping radius from `volute/volute.py`, with its closest
approach and the angle between its openings recorded beside them.

**The total turning of a trace is worth checking, and it is 0.** An opening
faces out of the tube, so the mouth faces back along the run and the bell
forwards; they are opposed when the turns cancel. 180 degrees is the wrong
answer and puts both openings on the same heading - `--shape=opposed` exists
to get it right. The volute's openings come out 135
degrees apart, and its bore comes within 7.75mm of itself, which is why it is
drawn and not cut.

A trace measured off a cut file is not exact: widths scatter, turns land a few
degrees off, and stations a few millimetres apart have to be merged against the
shortest real facet, `2*R*tan(FACET/2)`. **If the parameters ever turn up,
generate it instead and delete the trace.**

## A closed ring is a shape too

`--shape=torus` is a closed regular ring of FACET turns, and `offset()` mitres
a closed polyline's seam like any other vertex. Without that the two facets
either side of the join come out over-long - 53.35mm against 48.17 - and the
ring does not close.

At FACET 45 that is an octagon: eight facets, sitting at apothem
`RADIUS*cos(22.5)`, and offsetting by `+-bore/2` gives the two airway apothems.
`--radius` is the CIRCUMRADIUS of the centreline polygon, not an apothem, which
is the one thing to get right before comparing a ring here against a ring
measured off a cut file.

`ribbon_view.py` draws a closed loop with no mouth and no far end, because the
last station is the first.

### The seam is not a free end, and every torus ever drawn failed for it

`build()` trims each panel end back by `THICK/2*tan(phi/2)`, because a panel end
is a square cut and two neighbours meeting at a mitre otherwise jam on the
concave side before either is seated. `turn_at()` decided how far to trim, and
answered **0 at the first and last vertex** — *"a free end turns through 0"*,
which is right for a run and wrong for a ring. A closed polyline's first and
last vertex are one vertex and it turns there like any other.

So the two panels either side of the seam kept the ply the trim exists to take
off, and **`no two wall panels share plan area` failed with exactly 2 jamming
pairs — one per wall — on every torus at every facet count and every radius**.
0.37mm a panel at 13 facets, 0.62mm at 8, which is the 1.24mm the trim's own
comment quotes from the bench. `turn_at()` now wraps, the way `offset()`
already did at the seam mitre and for the same reason.

Nothing open moves: `poly[0] != poly[-1]` on a run, so it takes the old branch.
Checked rather than assumed — all six shapes, plain, `--port` and
`--port-both`, compared as geometry: **18 of 18 identical**.

### A ring cheek is two cuts, and it was one with a slit in it

`cheek()` builds the flat face by running out along one offset and back along
the other. On an open run that is one contour and it is right. On a ring the
two offsets are separate loops, and the list went round the outer one, stepped
across the band, round the inner one and back across the same step. **As a
polygon that is fine** — the two crossings coincide and cancel, so every inside
test and every one of the twelve checks read it correctly. **As a cut it is a
slit across the band and through the airway at the seam**: one `<path>`, one
`M`, one `Z`, and the laser follows the step like any other edge. Every ring
cheek shipped carried it — both torus variants, the scallop and the racetrack —
until 2026-09-16.

`contours()` now splits the outline where it returns to its first point, and
the sheet writes each loop as its own closed path. The outline stays one list
for the geometry, so no check had to change what it measures. What was missing
was a check on the black lines themselves: **`no cut line crosses the airway`**
walks every cut edge and requires it to stand half a bore off the centreline,
except the edge that closes an open run across its own tail. With the split
undone it fails the torus and the scallop, 3 points each; every open shape
passes it unchanged, and only the seven ring cheek sheets were rewritten —
every panel sheet reproduces byte for byte.

The scallop's seam sits on a vertex that does not turn, so `offset()` finds no
mitre there and its outer ring's two ends agree only to rounding. The split
matches within 1e-9, the tolerance `offset()` shuts a loop with; an exact
comparison left the scallop as one path.

### The oval is as small as a tooth allows

`--shape=oval` is a closed ellipse with its two long ends flattened and no
ports: half a loop taken twice, like the racetrack, so it closes by symmetry.
The half is a flat across the long end, an end arc, the side, and the end arc
again. `--oval-side-flat` puts a straight in the middle of each side, splitting
the side arc in two, so **the two long sides carry segments parallel to each
other and to the long axis**; the facet then has to divide half the side turn.

Its defaults are the shipped design in `oval/`, found by search for the
**smallest** loop meeting every check plus the rules of shape asked for: a flat
at each long end, a parallel straight in the middle of each long side, at least
two facets on each end arc, and a long axis at least 1.4 times the short.

At 30 degree facets: ends R28 turning 60, sides R72 turning 30 either side of a
12.5mm straight, 12.2mm flats — **314.4mm of centreline, a 148 x 116mm cheek**,
32 panels. What stops it shrinking is `the shortest panel still holds a tooth`:
10.09mm against 10. A 12.1mm flat, a 12mm side straight or R27.5 at the ends
fails it. 22.5 degrees is the only other facet that divides both turns with two
facets an end, and its smallest is 354mm.

The first oval (same day) had no side straights: 338.7mm, R95 sides of two
facets meeting at a point in the middle of each long side. A single side facet
is smaller still, 260.9mm, but its long sides are one straight panel from end
arc to end arc and it reads as a stretched decagon.

### The stadium: an o cut in half with straights put in

`--oval-end-deg=90` is the limit of the oval where the two end arcs make a whole
half-circle and the side arc turns nothing, so `--oval-side-flat` is the entire
side: **two half-circles of the tightest facets, turned until the sides come out
parallel, joined by two parallel straights**. It is refused without a side
straight, which would be a circle.

First drawn here as `ribbon-oval-bore10-45deg-R21.8-straight43.6-221mm`, then
moved to `~/LaserMadeMusic/GIT/lyre-harp/` as a prototype and deleted there on
2026-09-16. `ribbon_bore.py --shape=oval --facet=45 --oval-end-deg=90
--oval-end-r=21.8 --oval-flat=0 --oval-side-flat=43.6 --narrow` still draws it:
45 degree facets, four per half-circle, at **R21.8, the tightest radius any
check passes** — R21.7 leaves a 9.98mm inner panel against the 10mm a tooth
needs. The straights are the o's own diameter, 43.6mm, so the loop is twice as
long as it is wide: 220.7mm of centreline, a 124 x 79mm cheek, 20 panels.

45 degrees was chosen over 60, which is tighter at R19.5 but only three facets
a half-circle — a hexagon cut in half, 15.5% over at every mitre — and over 30,
which needs R27.8.

### `lyre_harp.py`: a closed duct whose width changes

Not a `--shape`, because every shape in `ribbon_bore.py` is two walls a fixed
bore either side of one centreline. The lyre-harp frame (2026-09-16) is two
independent closed walls: a stadium 400mm long outside, and a string hole with
a concentric arch, parallel sides and a bump between tangent corners. Over the
arch and down the sides the duct is 30 x 30mm; below the hole it opens to the
whole gap, about 200mm along the axis, which is the resonator. It imports the
panel, mortice, label, packer, sheet and ring-contour code from `ribbon_bore`
and adds only the two outlines and the checks a constant bore made
unnecessary. Its cut files go to `~/LaserMadeMusic/GIT/lyre-harp/`, where
nothing gates them.

The front cheek carries a sound hole: the 2-lead 7-bight knot from
`knotwork-soundholes`, read from that repository's cut file and placed
unchanged, centred on the axis two thirds of the way up the resonator's air
from the far end. So the cheeks are two parts now, A with the knot and B
without, each cut once. The knot's waste is cut with the mortices and its
crossing marks engraved. Two of those marks end 0.0007 and 0.0018mm past the
edge of a waste cut, rounding in the knot file, so a mark counts as in a hole
only when it is deeper than half a kerf.

`--drawing=PATH` draws the review drawing in `~/LaserMadeMusic/GIT/lyre-harp/` from the same `build()`: the
cheek's rims as cut, the air's faces, the knot as placed, and dimensions
measured off them. It stands the part upright by a quarter turn, not by
swapping x and y, which is a reflection and drew the knot mirrored.

`--render=PATH` writes the interactive 3D page that sits beside the cut files
in `~/LaserMadeMusic/GIT/lyre-harp/`: both cheeks with their holes and the knot,
and every panel as a board at its own position, angle and length, drawn with the
Three library, release r128, loaded from cdnjs. Tabs, slots and engraving are left off.

The hitch-pin block: loop-end strings go over hitch pins driven through the
bottom wall, and 3mm of ply cannot hold a pin, so six 3mm laminations are glued
up inside the bottom end, 18mm deep. In plan each lies against the outer wall's
face and is 30mm wide from it, over 8 facets' length centred on the axis. The
bottom end has an odd number of facets with one centred on the axis, so 8
whole facets cannot be symmetric: the span is 7 whole facets and a half at each
end, which also keeps the block's ends off the panel joints. Its checks compare
against 8 and 30 as asked, not against the constants that drew it.

Seven hitch pins, 2mm, 16mm apart across the axis and centred on it, go
through the front cheek into the block. Each sits on the block's mid-line, 15mm
in from the wall face, so the row follows the curve of the bottom end. They
are ENGRAVED on cheek A as drilling marks -- a 2mm circle with a cross through
it -- not cut: a hole in the cheek alone would not guide a drill on into the
block. A spacing the block cannot reach across is refused.

The tuning-pin block is the same idea at the arch: 6 laminations filling the
duct there, touching the outer wall's face and the string hole's, 30mm between
them. It spans 120 degrees -- out to the facet midpoint past the last pin,
which leaves 33.7mm of wood beyond it -- and carries one tuning pin above each
hitch pin, on the mid-line of the band and in line with it across the
instrument. Those marks are a cross with no circle: a tuning pin's diameter is
the builder's choice, and a ring drawn at a guess reads as the hole to drill.

Both blocks are written by one lamination_sheet(). Each span ends where a face
has a vertex -- the string hole's wall carries one every facet -- so both
builders drop a repeated point first: a zero-length run has no direction to
offset along, and the kerf offset came back as a 300mm spike.

**The lyre-harp is cut at a 0.17mm kerf, not this file's 0.15.** The test came
off the bed with loose finger joints (2026-09-20), and a wider kerf draws each
tab wider and each mortice narrower by half of the difference a side: 0.02mm on
each, 0.04mm of interference a joint. `lyre_harp.KERF` sets `ribbon_bore.BURN`
for its own run and nothing else. Raising it HERE would redraw all 61 shipped
ribbon sheets, which are the record of parts already cut.

`--test=PATH` writes an ARCH TEST PIECE: the string-hole wall's panels
TEST_FROM..TEST_TO, every outer panel that overlaps the arc they cover, and a
sector of the cheek for each side carrying their mortices, with TEST_MARGIN of
rim past the outermost one. It is for trying the joints before committing a
whole frame. Two things the first cut of it got wrong: angles wrap at the
resonator end, so a panel down there read as an arch angle and joined the list
until the outer run was pinned to the arch side; and choosing outer panels by
their midpoint dropped the two at the ends of the arc, which share their joint
with the inner run, so they are chosen by overlap instead. It refuses to write
if a mortice corner falls outside the sector.

The faces are drawn and the walls derived from them. Drawn the other way the
duct over the arch came out 29.72mm (on-circle vertices on the outer wall),
then 29.987mm (the hole face's mitred vertices), and `the duct is never
narrower than the bore` caught both.

### Two ports on a ring are two paths, and that is not a duct

`--port-at=i,j` puts the ports on **named facets** instead of at the two ends of
the run. Facet `i` runs from vertex `i` to vertex `i+1`, and the hole goes
`--port-from-tip` along it from vertex `i` — so `--port-at=0` **is** the mouth
port, verified identical on all six shapes, and the flag subsumes the old path
rather than sitting beside it.

It exists because a closed ring has no ends. `cline[0]` and `cline[-1]` are one
vertex on a torus, so `--port-both` put both ports 19.4mm apart either side of
the seam and nothing moved them. Almost nothing else had to learn about it: the
per-cheek split, `teeth_kept()`, the label dodge, three checks and the
narrow-rim web all read `port_holes()` and never ask where a port came from.

The list length is the port count, so it **replaces** `--port-both` rather than
joining it, and the two together are refused — each answers "how many ports and
where", and two answers is one too many. `--cap` is refused with it too:
`caps()` counts ported *run ends* and `--port-at` ports none of them.

### The port separation is the ring's tuning dial

**Two ports on a ring leave the air two paths, and here that is the point.** The
ring is a resonator with two parallel branches, not a duct, and it is not trying
to be one. Ports on facets `0` and `K` split an n-ring into `K` facets one way
and `n-K` the other, so **K is the dial** and it runs 1 to `n//2` — most
lopsided at 1, nearest balanced at `n//2`.

The 13 ring, every K it has, at both ends of its radius band. The **difference**
sets the first destructive null, `c/2d` at 343m/s, plane-wave and no end
correction — indicative, not a measurement:

| K | paths (facets) | ratio | R40 difference | null | R135 difference | null |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 / 12 | 1:12 | 210.6mm | 814 Hz | 710.8mm | 241 Hz |
| 2 | 2 / 11 | 2:11 | 172.3mm | 995 Hz | 581.5mm | 295 Hz |
| 3 | 3 / 10 | 3:10 | 134.0mm | 1280 Hz | 452.3mm | 379 Hz |
| 4 | 4 / 9 | 4:9 | 95.7mm | 1792 Hz | 323.1mm | 531 Hz |
| 5 | 5 / 8 | 5:8 | 57.4mm | 2986 Hz | 193.8mm | 885 Hz |
| 6 | 6 / 7 | 6:7 | 19.1mm | 8958 Hz | 64.6mm | 2654 Hz |

**K=6 is the least uneven split a 13 ring has, not the most**, which is worth
saying because `--port-at=0,6` reads like the natural middle and is one end of
the range. At R40 its difference is a single facet and the first null is up at
9kHz, near enough no audible branch effect at all; K=1 at R135 puts it at 241Hz,
in the playing register.

**An odd n cannot produce equal paths.** An even ring has `K = n/2` exactly
antipodal — two identical branches, in phase, the effect gone. 13 has no such K;
its closest split still differs by one facet. That is a reason to choose an odd
facet count, not an accident of having chosen one. More lopsided than 1:12 means
a bigger n: `--facet=14.4` is n=25, floor R68 (it grows as `17/(2 sin(pi/n))`),
ceiling R134, and K=1 there is 1:24 — 33mm against 782mm at R130, first null
229Hz.

Every K from 1 to `n//2` passes all twelve checks at every radius in the band,
measured at n=13 R40 and R135 and at n=25. The checks are all geometric and have
no opinion about any of this; they say it can be cut, not that it is in tune.

If a **single** path is ever wanted instead, the ring has to be blocked between
the ports, and the only block position leaving no dead side-branch is one
adjacent to both of them — which forces the ports adjacent to each other, which
is the end-based placement again. Recorded because it is the question a reader
asks at this point, not because anything here wants it.

### A ported ring's window depends on n, and the table has to say which n

**Every number in this section is from this command**, which is the thing the
first version of it left out and the reason two readers got two answers:

    python3 ribbon_bore.py --shape=torus --facet=F --radius=R \
            --port --port-at=0,K --no-write

`n = round(360/F)` facets, `K = n//2` so the ports sit opposite. A DEFAULT torus
is `--facet=30`, so n=12 and 24 wall panels; the 13 ring is
`--facet=27.6923076923`, n=13, 26 panels. **The two rings have different floors
and different ceilings**, and a table that names neither its facet angle nor its
port facets is a table about no particular ring.

| | n = 12 (`--facet=30`) | n = 13 (`--facet=27.6923076923`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| floor | **R32.9** (R32.8 refuses, 16.98mm of facet) | **R36** (R35.5 refuses, 16.99mm) |
| ceiling | **R133**, sheet 594 x 307 | **R135**, sheet 599 x 306 |
| first refused | R134, *"a part is 289 x 289mm"* | R136, *"a part is 290 x 288mm"* |
| duct at the ceiling | 826mm | 840mm |

The FLOOR is not the bend radius and not the tooth. A port needs
`PORT_FROM_TIP + PORT_ALONG/2` = **17mm of the facet it is measured along**, and
a ring's facet is `2*R*sin(pi/n)`, so

    R >= 17 / (2 sin(pi/n))          32.84 at n=12,  35.52 at n=13

and the generator refuses below it by name — *"the port spans 3.00 to 17.00mm
along facet 0, which is 16.99mm long"* — which reads like a port problem and is
one. **Radius is the dial.** A reader reaching for `--port-at` on a default ring
(R30, 15.53mm of facet) hits this before anything else.

The CEILING is the cheek against the bed. It is one part and a disc, so the
bed's **288mm of usable height** is what runs out, not its 580mm of width. The
1000mm the shipped designs run to needs R160.7 at n=13 and a 338 x 336mm cheek;
nesting cannot save it, because the cheek is one part.

**Do not read the ceiling off the sheet size.** There are TWO bed limits and
they are measured against different things:

| | limit | set in | applies to |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| *the sheet* | 600 x 308 | the `every sheet fits the P2S bed` check, `w > BED_W or h > BED_H` | a finished sheet |
| *the part* | 580 x 288 | `pack()`, `use_w, use_h = BED_W - 2*margin, BED_H - 2*margin` | one part, and it is what a refusal quotes |

The part limit is the smaller because `pack()` packs into the bed **minus a
margin all round**, and its docstring says why: filling to the edge gave *"a
sheet 600 x 307 on a 600 x 308 bed, which passes a fits-the-bed check and
cannot be positioned on a real machine"*.

So a ring at its ceiling prints a sheet taller than 288 — 599 x 306 at n=13 —
and is correct, because that number is measured against 308 and not against
288. Reading `306 > 288` off that row concludes the opposite, and it is the
inference the two limits invite: the row that reports a sheet sits directly
beneath refusals that quote a part.

### `--facet=60` has no passing radius, and changes how it fails at R133

Coarsening `--facet` widens the facet and does not rescue a ring. At
`--facet=60` — n=6, so the comparable run is `--port-at=0,3` — the ring clears
the port check and fails *the web outboard of a slot is cuttable* at **0.951mm**
against the 1.5mm needed. Not a radius failure: 0.951mm at R30, R60, R120, R130
and R132 alike, because 60 degree facets put the mortices that close to the rim
whatever the ring's size.

At **R133** it stops failing that check and starts failing before any check
runs — the bed refuses the cheek outright, *"a part is 250 x 289mm"*. The
conclusion is unchanged, and R133 is the crossover: R132 reaches the checks,
R133 does not.

That is worth saying because of how the upper end reads if you count one signal.
`--facet=60 --radius=300` prints **zero FAIL lines**, and zero FAIL lines there
means zero checks, not a clean run. Every row in `all-gates.sh` asserts the PASS
count as well for exactly this reason, and its header says so: absence of bad
news is not good news.

**Both numbers in this section were wrong once for the same reason** — an
absolute written from samples that could not disprove it. "R120 is the smallest
radius that passes" came from probing only 120 and up; "the mode changes at
R150" came from probing 120 then 150 and never narrowing. Sweep across the
boundary you mean to name, not away from it.

`--facet` wants eleven decimal places for a 13 ring. The divisibility guard is
`1e-9` absolute, so `--facet=27.692307692` is refused and `27.6923076923` is
accepted. A facet *count* would be the better flag, and is not written.

## The cheek gets its own file, and that file is cut twice

The two cheeks are the same part, so one file run twice is the whole job -
**but only if nothing else is on that sheet.** A `pack()` that fills the second
cheek's sheet with panels leaves you thirteen panels short when you cut one sheet
twice, with nothing to notice it but counting. `items_for()` emits ONE cheek and
`sheet()` packs cheeks and panels as separate groups:

    ...-cheek-x2-cut-files.svg     one cheek. Cut it twice.
    ...-panels-cut-files.svg       every wall panel. Cut once.

`x2` is the bell's convention - `bell-round10-...-x3-...` means three plies -
so the count of copies lives in the name, where a reader looking at a folder
finds it.

It also nests better: the serpentine takes two sheets rather than three, because
the panels do not have to fit around a cheek.

## One sheet per bedful

`pack()` row-wraps into `BED - 2 x margin`, not into the bed. Filling to the
edge gives a sheet **600 x 307 on a 600 x 308 bed** — which passes a fits-the-bed
check and cannot be positioned on a real machine. A part bigger than the usable
area is a refusal, not a smaller sheet.

## Kerf goes opposite ways on a part and on a hole

The laser removes `BURN` centred on the line, so a part comes out `BURN` under
and a hole `BURN` over. Every panel dimension is therefore drawn `BURN` **over**
and every slot `BURN` **under**, plus `PLAY` per side taken out of the slot and
never off the tab — `bore_split.py`'s standing rule, and its 0.025mm figure for
the 10mm bore.

Measured back out of the written file rather than asserted: a 6.100mm drawn tab
and a 5.950mm drawn slot give a 6.000mm tab in a 6.050mm slot, 0.025mm a side.

## Both cheeks are the same part, and both go on the same way up

Outline, slots and engraving are identical - checked against the written files,
not assumed.

**Whether a flipped cheek would fit depends on the shape**, so `flippable()`
reports it and does not guess. A simple U *is* congruent to its own mirror:
turn it over, rotate 180 degrees, and every tab lands. The serpentine is not, at
any angle. The instruction is the same either way, because a flipped cheek
carries its numbers mirrored and facing into the bore - so one cheek always has
its numbers on the inside, which is the cheaper of the two mistakes.

**`flippable()` matches nearest points as a bijection**, and must not zip two
sorted point lists. Sorting is unstable under a small perturbation: two nearly
equal points swap order and every pair after them is compared with the wrong
partner, so a 0.025mm difference reads as 20.7mm of error and answers the
question the wrong way round.

## The cheek stops 2mm outboard of its slots

`WEB`, not `MARGIN`, is the number to change — `MARGIN` is derived from it.
The band is `bore + 2 × (thickness/2 + WEB)`: 17mm at the 10mm bore. Asked for
"as thin as possible" and 2mm is the answer that still cuts; 1.5mm is the floor
in 3mm birch.

The knock-on is that there is no flange left to engrave on, so the cheek's
panel numbers moved **into the channel**, which is the floor of the bore. Two
checks hold that: no engraved point off its own part, and none inside a slot.

## The flat gate applies here, with one flag

`flat-part-check.py` reads these sheets, and it is worth running -- it is what
catches a port cutting into a tab slot, which every check in this file passes.
Run it as

    python3 $G/flat-part-check.py --dir . --min-edge 1.5

**The flag is not optional.** Its default floor is 3.0mm because it was written
for a bullroarer's cord hole, which is under string tension and tears out; a
cheek slot is not. Without it every ported cheek fails at 1.66mm against 3.00
and the noise hides anything real. With it they pass 18 checks, 0 failed.

Two of its checks do not apply to these files at all. *holes are inside the
outline* assumes one part per sheet, and a panels sheet carries twenty; *hole is
big enough* then measures the gaps between parts. Read those two as noise here.

## Every check, against geometry it should reject

The method: give each check something it ought to fail, and see whether it does.
A check nobody has watched fail is a check nobody has tested. Eleven checks can
pass on panel corners that jam at every mitre.

**Effective — observed to fail on bad geometry:**

- *the ply between two holes survives the kerf* — the best-evidenced check here,
  because what made it fail was a shipped design rather than a mutation: 0.030mm
  where 1.5mm was needed. It is what refuses a port that would break into a tab
  slot. Nothing shipped fails it — see the note on the round port's zero margin
  below, which is why.
- *the two walls stand a bore apart* — 3mm on a hairpin tighter than its own wall
- *no two wall panels share plan area* — one jamming pair per mitre, all eight designs
- *the cheek outline does not cross itself* — four packed spirals and a tight dspiral
- *every slot corner is inside its cheek* — the wave at a R25 trough
- *the web outboard of a slot is cuttable* — the same wave, and any WEB under 1.5
- *panels merged by `--merge-lead` keep their own teeth and numbers* — not a
  check but a rule, and the reason `merge_lead()` is forty lines rather than
  four. `teeth()` reads a panel's length alone, so the 43.2mm merged panel
  would get three teeth at -12, 0, +12 where its 23.2mm half had two at -6, +6,
  and one of the three lands at 9.6mm along the duct, inside a port spanning
  3.07 to 12.94. Tags are worse: `build()` numbers by position, so dropping two
  panels renumbers all 36 that remain and a panel already cut reads a number
  that now means a different one. The label is pinned separately from the
  midpoint, or it slides half a lead off the mortices it names.
- *`--port-both` has four panels a wall to fold* — watched to fail at three and
  to pass at four, but ONLY by calling `merge_lead()` directly with a made-up
  wall. No shape reaches it from the command line: any lead that bends into its
  first facet trips the collinearity refusal first, and the shortest double
  spiral that builds at all — `--ds-half --ds-facets=1`, 160.6mm — still has
  panels to spare. Keep it: without it the two folds meet in the middle and the
  second reads a length the first has already changed, re-spacing the teeth of
  a panel whose mortices are settled. But do not read it as evidence the way
  the checks above are read. What has been watched is the function, not a
  design.
- *the rim is flush with every mortice* — `--narrow` only, in place of the web
  check, which under `--narrow` could not fail. Watched fail twice: pushing
  `cheek_off()` 0.2mm off `slot_half()` reported 0.2000mm against 0.065 allowed,
  and `--shape=serpentine --narrow` reports 1.2182mm, because a narrow rim cuts
  into twelve mortices on the tight lobe. The serpentine cannot be cut narrow,
  and the two checks that say so both refuse it and write nothing.
- *every engraved point is on its own part* — found 18 points off, the two cheek labels
- *no engraving lands in a slot* — see the section above; it has been wrong twice
  and was caught both times by the count printed beside the verdict

**Cannot fail, and should not be read as evidence:**

- *the airway is the bore along every facet* — it compares two offsets of ONE
  polyline, which are parallel to each facet at a fixed separation by
  construction. It returns the bore for a straight line, a hairpin tighter than
  its own wall, and a zigzag reversing at every vertex. Keep it: it is the
  arithmetic of the section, and it would catch a mistake in `offset()`. But the
  check that answers "is the airway the bore" is *the two walls stand a bore
  apart*, which measures the walls as bodies.
- *the shortest panel still holds a tooth* — `build()` raises on the identical
  condition before `checks()` runs, so this restates a guard that has already
  fired. The number it prints is real; the verdict is not.
- *every sheet fits the P2S bed* — `sheet()` raises on an oversized part first.
  Every attempt to make a sheet overflow tripped that instead.

**Asks the wrong question:** *no two slots overlap*. Eighteen mutations never
reach it, and it passes a real defect: a port 0.029mm from a slot is not an
overlap, and IS one hole once a kerf has been down both edges. Overlap is not
the question; surviving material is. *the ply between two holes survives the
kerf* asks that, and it is what decides where a port may sit.

**The round port is placed hard against that limit, by construction.** `port()`
keeps a tooth only where the gap clears `MIN_FEATURE + BURN`, so the surviving
tooth lands exactly on the minimum: every round-ported design — serpentine,
opposed and the R35to113 spiral — reports 1.650mm drawn, 1.500mm left, against
1.5mm needed. A margin of **zero**, and it passes only because
the comparison carries a 1e-9 slack; without it the sum came out
1.6499999999999986 and the design was refused over 1.3e-15mm.

The square port is nothing like as tight, because `--merge-lead` gives it a
whole facet to sit in: 2.2 to 4.5mm of margin across the eight square-ported
designs, the volute narrowest at 3.736mm and the R36to144 spiral widest at
5.950mm. The eighth is the 1000mm double spiral, which is square-ported at BOTH
ends and reports the same 4.672mm at each -- `--port-both` folds the tail lead
as well, so its far port gets the whole facet the mouth's does.

## A port seats a BELL in 3mm of ply. Nothing has seated a mouthpiece in one

The stack is 16mm through and a port is cut in ONE cheek, so whatever goes into
it meets 3mm of birch and not the whole sandwich. That reads thin on paper and
it is the first thing anyone asks about this joint.

**For a bell it holds, and there is a photograph of it holding.** The R35to113
spiral is square-ported and glued up, and its bell is seated in the port — a
ring-stack shank standing up out of the plane of the coil, carried by a 10 x 10mm
hole through one 3mm cheek.

![The R35to113 spiral bore glued up in pale birch, its finger joints and
engraved panel numbers visible along every seam, with the ring-stack bell
standing vertically out of the plane of the coil where its shank seats in the
square port, and the mouthpiece on the lead at the far
end](../../../../built/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113/ribbon-spiral-bore10-45deg-R35to113-1000mm-ported-square-narrow-cheek-x2-glued-up_web.jpg)

**THE MOUTHPIECE IS NOT ON A PORT ON EITHER BUILT INSTRUMENT.** Look at the
photograph again: the bell stands in the port, and the mouthpiece is out on the
lead, seated in the TUBE END where the four walls grip the full 16mm depth. The
three-turn trumpet does the same at both of its ends.

![The built three-turn trumpet laid flat: a square-section lattice bore in
scorched, shellacked birch with its finger joints alternating light and dark
along every seam, the stacked-ring mouthpiece seated in the end of the square
run at one end and the flared ring-stack bell at the
other](../../../../built/coil-fold2-long-straight-3t/bore10-coil-fold2-long-straight-3t_web.jpg)

They are different joints, and only one of the two has been asked to hold a
mouthpiece. A bell sits where it is put; a mouthpiece takes lip pressure and
whatever the player leans into it, which is the load the 3mm has never seen.
Do not read the bell in that port as settling the mouthpiece.

**SO THE 1000mm DOUBLE SPIRAL SHIPS BOTH ARRANGEMENTS**, and the folder holds
three sheet sets because of it:

    ...-1000mm-narrow-*                      no ports at all, the plain coil
    ...-1000mm-ported-square-narrow-*        ONE port, one cap, one open end
    ...-1000mm-ported-both-square-narrow-*   TWO ports, two caps, both ends shut

The one-port set is the spiral's arrangement, the one that exists in wood: the
port takes the bell, its stub is capped, and the far rim end stays open for the
mouthpiece to seat on the tube end where four walls grip 16mm. It is `--port`
without `--port-both`, and its port goes through BOTH cheeks, so one face of it
is a hole to plug — which is the cost `--port-per-cheek` exists to avoid and
which the built spiral pays.

The two-port set is the one that needs nothing plugged and puts the mouthpiece
and the bell on opposite faces. It is also the one whose mouth port has never
been made. Cut the 240mm coupon first if that is the one you want.

Each has a page of its own, because the airways differ. In
`dspiral/ribbon-dspiral-bore10-30deg-R62-pitch46-1000mm/`, the page named for
the folder is the TWO-port bore and the one whose name ends `-ported-square` is
the one-port — which is the opposite of how the sheets read, where the plainer
name is the plainer part. The page takes the folder's name because that is what
every other design does and what `ribbon_view.py` writes without `--out`.

`cap()`'s own docstring has it the other way round — *"the mouthpiece goes into
the port and the run simply stops a bore further on"* — and the built spiral
does the opposite, putting the bell there. The generator is not wrong about the
geometry, which does not care which end is which, but the sentence describes an
instrument nobody has made.

**So a change to `MIN_FEATURE`, `BURN` or `THICK` is a change to whether the
four round-ported designs draw at all**, and they will fail together rather
than one at a time. The square-ported eight have room to absorb it. Measure
after any such change rather than assuming the check is quiet because nothing
is close to it.

A check can be worse than unproven. This one was actively wrong, and it took a
different tool -- `flat-part-check`, which had never been pointed at these files
-- to say so.

**The pattern in all three failures.** Each vacuous check compared a thing with
itself: two offsets of one polyline, a guard with its own precondition, a
constant with a constant. **A check earns its place by being watched to fail.**

## volute.py and ribbon_view.py, checked the same way

**`volute.py`.** Two of its four checks are failing on the shipped design right
now — *the bore stays clear of itself* at 7.75mm against the 20mm band, and
*the two openings are opposed* at 135 degrees — which is the file's whole point
and makes them the best-evidenced checks in the repository. *the cheek fits the
P2S bed* fires from `--r0=200` up. Its two refusals hold: an arc under the tooth
floor, and a facet angle that does not divide a semicircle.

Those two failing checks are one condition stated twice, and they agree: the run
turns 1035 degrees, 315 past a whole number of turns, and an opening faces out
of the tube, so the openings sit (315 + 180) mod 360 = 135 degrees apart.

*every arc holds a tooth* cannot fail — `centreline()` raises on the same
condition first, exactly as `the shortest panel still holds a tooth` does in
`ribbon_bore.py`.

**`ribbon_view.py`.** It no longer keeps a copy of the generator's argument
handling. It diverged four ways by 2026-09-16 — the generator ignored flags the
viewer refused, the viewer drew pages for combinations the generator refuses,
both quoted R30 for the scallop and racetrack, and the viewer's own naming rule
would have written three pages over other designs' pages. Now the viewer calls
`ribbon_bore.read_flags()` for the design, `bend_radius()` for the quoted
radius and `port_holes()` for the facet refusals, and it takes only `--out`,
`--home`, `--embed` and `--trace` itself. **`--out` is required**: design
folders are named by hand, so a page's path cannot be derived. A shape with no
title exits saying to add one.

One rough edge fixed: a refusal from the generator escaped as a traceback
instead of the sentence the generator wrote. `ribbon_bore`'s `__main__` has
caught `ValueError` all along; this one now does too.

## Look at the render. The checks do not see the drawing

Two defects in this generator got through every check and were caught by
screenshotting the SVG:

- **Every glyph was mirrored top to bottom.** The glyph table's y runs up and
  SVG's runs down. A `2` came out as something that is not a `2`, and no
  geometric invariant cares.
- **The cheek's own number was engraved in the hole in the middle of the arch.**
  The centre of a U's bounding box is air.

`checks()` now includes *every engraved point is on its own part*, which found
the second one immediately — 18 points off, exactly the two cheek labels. It is
there because the render found it first. **Screenshot the SVG after any change
to drawing code.**

A third, from the same family: *no engraving lands in a slot* was written
comparing ink in sheet coordinates against slots rebuilt at design
coordinates. Two spaces that cannot overlap, so it passed, and the tell was
that it said **16 slots on a sheet that has 32**. A count printed beside a
verdict is what makes that visible. Both now come out of `sheet()`, which is
the only place that knows where anything was actually put.

Then it failed the same way again once there were several sheets: it compared
ink on sheet 3 against slots on sheet 1. Two sheets are two files and their
coordinates have nothing to do with each other. Both are now tagged with their
sheet. **Twice in one file is a pattern, not bad luck: any check comparing two
sets of coordinates must first establish what space they are both in.**

Every check reports its own count (`40 stations`, `504 points`, `120 pairs`) so
a check that measured nothing cannot print the same clean line as one that
measured everything.

## `id="..."` contains `d="..."`

Measuring the output with `re.findall(r'd="([^"]+)"')` matches the `id`
attribute too and hands you `slots` where a coordinate should be. Use
`(?:^|\s)d="`. The octagonal writeup records the same trap; it still cost
a run here.

**A failing run deletes its output**, which is right — a sheet that failed a
check should not be sitting there looking cuttable. It also means a copy of
this script tried out in this folder writes to, and then deletes, the real cut
file. That happened. Use `--out` for trials.

## `ribbon_view.py` draws the airway, and nothing else

One self-contained page per design, beside the cut files it belongs to, so the
thing you cut and the thing you turn around cannot drift apart. Same flags as
the generator.

**It draws the passage, bounded by the wall faces at ±bore/2.** That is the
whole reason it exists: the bore was cut 3mm narrow for a week and nothing here
drew the space inside it. A picture of the plywood alone would not have shown
it; a picture of the airway would.

**The page draws the airway and not the cheek plates.** Drawing the plates at
full band width answers a real objection — the airway on its own reads as a much
thinner object than the part you cut — but it makes every look inside a look
through a solid slab of ply, which is the one thing this page must not make
hard. A page has six faces: the four wall-and-cheek ones, plus `mouth` and
`far end` where the bore is not a closed ring. `ply, top` and `ply, bottom` in a
key belong to no page this generator draws. What the plates would say — 20mm of
band around a 10mm passage — the numbers panel says in words and the cut files
show to scale.

**A flag missing from the `known` set is refused by the guard that reads it.**
`--trace` has its own handler forty lines below that guard, and leaving it out
of `known` makes the traced page impossible to redraw at all — while the copy in
the repository goes stale without anyone finding out. A guard listing what is
allowed has to be edited when something is added, and this is the second thing
in this file that a second copy of the argument handling can quietly lose.

It reuses `offset()` for the wall faces rather than reading the cut files, so
it cannot disagree with the generator about where anything is. It is *not* the
lattice viewer in `../../../../tools/viewer.py`: that one is built on integer cells and cube
faces with occupancy-based hidden-face removal, and there is no lattice here.

`--embed` writes a compact build for an iframe: canvas only, a caption, a slow
idle turn that stops on the first interaction and never starts under
`prefers-reduced-motion`. **The drawing code is extracted from the full page's
own `<script>` rather than copied**, so an embed cannot quietly diverge from
the page it links to. It drops three lines the embed declares for itself; the
first version sliced off the leading blank line instead, left `const D`
declared twice, and rendered a blank canvas.

`gernreich.github.io` embeds one. Regenerate it from here when the geometry
changes:

```sh
python3 ribbon_view.py --shape=serpentine --embed \
    --out=../../../../../Gernreich.github.io/bore-viewer.html \
    --home=https://gernreich.github.io/trumpet-elbows-not-allowed/
```

An embed follows `prefers-color-scheme`, because it sits inside somebody
else's page. It cannot see an explicit theme toggle on the host — a frame is
its own document — so it matches by default and not after a manual switch.

**all-gates.sh gates it**, by running the command above into a temp file and
comparing. It is the only artefact crossing two repositories, so without that
gate the published copy drifts from what this generator draws and nothing
reports it.

That gate compares bytes, which is not the same as looking: a render can be
wrong while every check passes. Look at the page after changing it.

## Previews, because a cut file is invisible on a page

`previews/` holds a readable rendering of every cut file, built by
`lasermade-tools/make-preview.py`. Same geometry, same cut order, thicker
strokes, and the three inks that fail contrast on a light ground darkened.
Rebuild them whenever a cut file changes — verified by comparing the path data,
which must be identical to the source.

`previews/old/` mirrors each design's `cut-files/old/` and holds the previews of
the superseded sheets. They are kept for the same reason the sheets are: a
preview is the only readable picture of what a superseded sheet cut. They sit
out of `previews/` rather than in it because `all-gates.sh` walks every
`previews/` directory and asks each file for its cut file — a preview whose
sheet has moved reads as stale, correctly, and a pile of them would drown the
one real staleness the gate exists to report.

Every `old/` in this repository is gitignored, this one
included. They are a local archive on the working disk, not part of what the
repository ships, and a fresh clone has none of them — so the pictures above
are the only readable record of the full-width sheets, and they are one disk
deep.

## Colour is the cut order

Shared across all these repositories: **blue engraves, then green → orange →
cyan → black**; black frees the part; violet `#8000ff` means skip. This sheet
uses three — blue for the numbers, orange for the slots so the cheek is cut
while the sheet still holds it, black for the outlines.

## Cut files belong to the author

- **Stage by name.** Never `git add -A` or `git add .`.
- Do not regenerate a cut file the author has hand-edited without asking.
- Commit straight to `main`. Push only when asked.

# a viewer revision behind before anyone looked. Two were worse than behind --
# their vertices did not match the flags their folder names claim, so they drew
# a bore nobody had drawn. `design pages match their generator` rebuilds each
# into a temp and compares, which is `previews current with their cut files`
# applied to the pages instead of the sheets.

# Every current sheet, from every design folder, into the ONE previews/ here.
# `ribbon-*.svg` matched nothing once the sheets moved down into per-design
# cut-files/ folders, and make-preview.py's default output is previews/ beside
# ITS SOURCE -- so the bare loop wrote eleven scattered previews/ directories
# and left the real one stale. The output path is given explicitly for that
# reason, and -not -path '*/old/*' keeps superseded sheets out.
